"""Pre-pass script for the Sum of Multiples Kata."""

# -------------------------------------
# VALIDATION
# -------------------------------------
# The input should be validated to ensure that:
# - `limit` is a positive integer.
# - `magical_items` is a list of positive integers.

# -------------------------------------
# INPUT
# -------------------------------------
# The input consists of two variables:
# - 'limit': an integer representing the level number that the player completed.
# - `magical_items`: a list of integers representing the base values of magical items collected

# -------------------------------------
# OUTPUT
# -------------------------------------
# The output is a single integer representing the sum of all the multiples of the given magical items
# that are less than the specified level.

# -------------------------------------
# CALCULATION / LOGIC
# -------------------------------------
# The points awarded depend on two things:
# - The level (a number) that the player completed.
# - The base value of each magical item collected by the player during that level.

# The energy points are awarded according to the following rules:
# - For each magical item, take the base value and find all the multiples of that value that are less than the level number.
# - Combine the sets of numbers.
# - Remove any duplicates.
# - Calculate the sum of all the numbers that are left.

# -------------------------------------
# EXAMPLE
# -------------------------------------
# If the player completed level 10 and collected magical items with base values of 2 and 3,
# the multiples of these values that are less than 10 are:
# - Multiples of 2: 2, 4, 6, 8
# - Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9
# The combined set of multiples is {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}.
# The sum of these numbers is 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 32.
# Therefore, the output should be 32.
