"""This module contains the prepass for the allergies module."""

# -------------------
# INPUTS / MAPPINGS
# -------------------
# List of allergens and their corresponding scores as per the problem statement
# This is a constant mapping used for allergy score calculations
ALLERGEN_SCORES = {
    "eggs": 1,
    "...": 99,
}

# -------------------
# CLASS DEFINITION
# -------------------
# The Allergies class encapsulates the logic for determining allergies based on a score
# The class consists of
# - An initializer to set up the allergy score
# - A method to check if allergic to a specific item that is passed as an argument
# - A property to get the list of allergies based on the score

# -------------------
# OUTPUTS
# -------------------
# The method return a bool indicating whether the person is allergic to the specified item
# The property returns a list[str] of allergens matched to the allergy score

# -------------------
# Method Definition
# -------------------
# First, we will check if the item is in the allergen list.
# If not, return False.
# If yes, continue with the allergy check logic:
# - 

# -------------------------------
# Explanation of Property Usage
# -------------------------------
# Why do we use a property instead of a method?
# - A property is used when we want to expose an attribute-like interface for something computed dynamically.
# - It hides the computation, making the code cleaner and more intuitive.
# - The allergies list is conceptually an attribute of the object, not an action, so a property is more appropriate.
# - Using a property allows access like `obj.allergies` instead of `obj.get_allergies()`, which is more Pythonic.
# - Methods are better suited for actions or operations requiring parameters, while properties are for attributes.
