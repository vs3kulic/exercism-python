üîç HOW TO RECOGNIZE REQUIREMENTS FROM PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

üìã REQUIREMENT TYPES TO LOOK FOR:
1. Data Requirements ‚Üí What things need to be stored/tracked?
2. Behavioral Requirements ‚Üí What actions/processes need to happen?  
3. Business Rules ‚Üí What calculations/constraints apply?
4. Examples ‚Üí Concrete scenarios that illustrate the rules

üîç KEY PHRASES THAT SIGNAL REQUIREMENTS:
- "This class has..." ‚Üí Data requirements
- "You can do this by..." ‚Üí Process requirements
- "The highest score is..." ‚Üí Calculation requirements  
- "For example..." ‚Üí Validation examples

APPLIED TO HIGH SCORES:

üéØ REQUIREMENT 1: Score Management
FOUND IN README: "Manage a game player's High Score list."
PATTERN: MANAGEMENT VERBS that indicate the system needs to store and organize data.

üéØ REQUIREMENT 2: Highest Score Retrieval
FOUND IN README: "write methods that return the highest score from the list"
PATTERN: SUPERLATIVE DESCRIPTIONS that indicate finding optimal values.

üéØ REQUIREMENT 3: Latest Score Access
FOUND IN README: "write methods that return... the last added score"
PATTERN: TEMPORAL REFERENCES that indicate sequence/order matters.

üéØ REQUIREMENT 4: Top Three Rankings
FOUND IN README: "write methods that return... the three highest scores"
PATTERN: QUANTITY + RANKING that indicates sorting and limiting results.

# STEP 3: DESIGN DECISIONS - WHY CHOOSE SPECIFIC APPROACHES
# =============================================================================

"""
üéØ DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Is it DATA? ‚Üí Class attribute or variable
2. Is it ACCESS? ‚Üí Instance method with safe indexing
3. Is it CALCULATION? ‚Üí Built-in function with edge case handling
4. Is it COLLECTION OPERATION? ‚Üí Sort/filter/slice operations
5. Does it need ERROR HANDLING? ‚Üí Guard clauses or conditional expressions

APPLIED TO HIGH SCORES:

WHY ALL METHODS ARE INSTANCE METHODS:
- They operate on the specific instance's score data
- Each HighScores object has its own score list
- Methods provide controlled access to internal data
- Encapsulation: scores are accessed through defined interface

WHY USE CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS FOR SAFETY:
- Empty lists cause exceptions with max() and indexing
- Better user experience than crashes
- Follows defensive programming principles
- Consistent error handling across methods

DESIGN PATTERN SUMMARY:
- Data storage ‚Üí instance attributes
- Data access ‚Üí instance methods with safety checks
- Collection operations ‚Üí built-in functions + slicing

# STEP 4: IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

"""
üîß CONCRETE IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES:

REQUIREMENT 1: Score Storage
SOLUTION: Store scores list as instance attribute
REASONING: Direct reference, no copying needed, preserves order

REQUIREMENT 2: Latest Score Access  
SOLUTION: Negative indexing with conditional expression
REASONING: [-1] is most Pythonic for "last item", safe with empty check

REQUIREMENT 3: Personal Best Calculation
SOLUTION: max() function with conditional expression
REASONING: Built-in max() is optimized, handles comparison logic

REQUIREMENT 4: Top Three Rankings
SOLUTION: sorted() with reverse=True, then slice [:3]
REASONING: sorted() doesn't modify original, slicing handles <3 items gracefully

KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS:
1. Use negative indexing [-1] for latest score
2. Use max() built-in for finding highest value
3. Use sorted(reverse=True) for descending order
4. Use slicing [:3] to get top three (safe for shorter lists)
5. Use conditional expressions for empty list safety

üõ°Ô∏è NULL OBJECT PATTERN - CONSISTENT RETURN TYPES:
This is a well-established pattern for handling "absence of data":

COLLECTIONS METHODS ‚Üí RETURN EMPTY COLLECTIONS:
- personal_top_three() returns [] (not None)
- Callers can always iterate safely
- No null checks needed before looping
- Consistent with Python standard library

SINGLE VALUE METHODS ‚Üí RETURN None FOR ABSENCE:
- latest() returns None when no scores
- personal_best() returns None when no scores  
- Explicit indication that no value exists
- Callers must handle None explicitly

EXAMPLES IN PYTHON STANDARD LIBRARY:
- "hello".split(",") returns [] not None
- dict.get("missing") returns None
- [].copy() returns [] not None
- re.search("pattern", text) returns None if no match

WHY THIS PATTERN MATTERS:
‚úÖ Type consistency - same method always returns same type
‚úÖ Easier iteration - no null checks before loops
‚úÖ Composability - empty collections work with other operations  
‚úÖ Less error-prone - reduces null reference exceptions

"""
üí° COMMON MISTAKES IN HIGH SCORES IMPLEMENTATION:

‚ùå INCONSISTENT RETURN TYPES:
- Returning None for collections (should return [])
- Returning [] for single values (should return None)
- Mixing exceptions and None returns

‚ùå UNSAFE OPERATIONS:
- Using scores[-1] without checking if list is empty
- Using max(scores) without checking if list is empty
- Not handling edge cases (empty lists, single items)

‚ùå INEFFICIENT OPERATIONS:
- Sorting the entire list when only top 3 needed (use heapq.nlargest)
- Creating unnecessary copies of data
- Re-sorting on every call instead of caching

‚ùå OVER-ENGINEERING:
- Adding complex validation when simple checks suffice
- Creating elaborate class hierarchies for simple data
- Implementing custom sorting when built-ins work fine

‚úÖ GOOD PRACTICES:
- Follow the Null Object Pattern for consistent returns
- Use built-in functions (max, sorted) when appropriate
- Handle edge cases explicitly and consistently
- Keep methods simple and focused on single responsibility
- Use Pythonic idioms (negative indexing, slicing)
